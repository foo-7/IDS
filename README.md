# UAV Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

This repository contains implementations of a hybrid **Random Forest â†’ Support Vector Classifier (RF--SVC)** and a **1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)** for multi-class UAV network intrusion detection. The project includes:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluations

## Setup
Requires Python 3.10+

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv <env_name>
source <env_name>/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
<env_name>\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

Afterwards, please install the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
